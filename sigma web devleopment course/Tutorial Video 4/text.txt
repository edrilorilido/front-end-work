ctrl + / -> comment out any code

alt + shift + down arrow key -> this replicate the line your on below

pressing alt and hitting left click on mouse will give you more cursor where
required

<h1></h1>, <h2></h2>......<h6></h6> -> header tag

<p></p> -> paragraph tag

lorem23 -> will give a paragraph with 23 words

lorem8 -> will give a paragrah with 8 words

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p> -> normal paragraph with some content

<p style="background-color: red;">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p> -> paragraph with attribute
style is atribute inside paragraph tag

so adding some color using style as an attribute inside a paragraph tag in an
.html file can also termed as in-line css, but the industry practice is to not use inline css, rather have all css properties in style.css file

anchor tag: using an anchor tag you can add urls & links
<a></a> -> this is what is called an anchor tag
<a href="https://www.google.com">open google</a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com">open google</a>
making use of target="_blank" in an anchor tag, when you click on the mentioned link that link will open up in a new web page

In bookmrkmanager.html we simply used anchor tag because of which all the links came in sme line

In bookmrkmngr.html we put the anchortags in paragraph tags which helped us see the links in  new line instead of a single line -> but this is not the correct approach to have different links in new line, instead we make use of something called as lists to have similar bunch of things in a new line
